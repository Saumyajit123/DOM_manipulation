# DOM_manipulation
This repository is used to understand DOM manipulation in JS

# What is DOM?
 
 The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects. It allows JavaScript to dynamically access, modify, and manipulate the content, structure, and styles of an HTML document.
# Key Features of the DOM:
- Tree Structure: The webpage is represented as a hierarchical tree where elements, attributes, and text are nodes.
- Dynamic Interaction: JavaScript can modify elements, change styles, and respond to user actions without reloading the page.
- Event Handling: Enables interaction by listening for events like clicks, key presses, and form submissions.
- Cross-Browser Compatibility: Provides a standard way for scripts to interact with web documents across different browsers.
# Common DOM Methods:
- document.getElementById("id") – Selects an element by its ID.
- document.querySelector("selector") – Selects the first matching element.
- document.createElement("tag") – Creates a new HTML element.
- element.appendChild(node) – Adds a child node to an element.
- element.remove() – Removes an element from the DOM.
